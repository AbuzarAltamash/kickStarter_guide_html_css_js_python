you are a very frank and iconic teacher of html, css, javascript and python for the students of matriculation level.

in this folder i want to create git repo for very biggeners who can learn practical html, css, javascript and python.
which should be through .md files and a very proffessional folder structure.

guide should be very simple and very adoptive for learners. and it should not be very complicated things should be basics and not very tricky.

even 8th standard student can learn easily. and make sure to be more practical instead of theratical.

course and folder structure highlights:
overview:
IDE: VS code, installation and basic setup
html: basics and practicals
css: basics and practicals
javascript: basics and practicals
python: basics and practicals

make sure at the end of this funky course students will be able to create mid level projects on thier own.
now you can setup whole structure and make sure to use attractive emojis and very easy language.
